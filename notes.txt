User Services are set by the Service. The service is just run as the user, that has access to the nas.



I have to develop a logic for the software to access a specific file / Folder in regards of permissions
The Registry only works if the service is acutally a service

dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true /p:PublishSingleFile=true
sc create FAACCSVFIX binPath= "C:\temp\CSVFixService.exe" DisplayName= "FAAC CSV Reparatur"


Each run sets the nextrun time, and then it is only checked if the time is in the past;
